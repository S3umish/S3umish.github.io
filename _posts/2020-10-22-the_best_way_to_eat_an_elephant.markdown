Here I am building a CLI app !!  can’t believe it, few weeks back, I had no clue how an app is created.

Going through this process is making me realize that how true is the quote by Creighton Abrams: 

 **“When eating an elephant, take one bite at a time.” **

Clearly, no one is encouraging dining on these fantastic animals, but it's good advice about how to tackle a huge, overwhelming project.

The “**Countrylist”** , is the elephant here.  In simple terms  it meant that I had to go slow , bit by bit to ensure that the program is working as desired and commit to GitHub frequently to save the work.

It was initially overwhelming to figure out the right API to work with, my cohort colleague came to rescue as she shared a List of APIs without key: https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/

I chose the Rest countries API, https://restcountries.eu/  and started working step by step as per the requirements.

Ensuring that the environment is setup, Github is linked , and various lessons on arrays, hashes , object orientation, using ‘pry’ , made it possible to write the code under different classes. 
Setting up a CLI class was the magical moment where running ruby bin/run on terminal brought the application alive. 

Countrylist is a learning resource , I would like to add more features to it by connecting it with other resources to get comprehensive information in one glance.

It was a great learning experience. A big shout out to my cohort lead “Madeline Stark” for the guidance and support needed to complete this assignment.

Thank you .
